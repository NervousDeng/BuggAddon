# BuggAddon

Don't you just hate when people `/spit` on you **ONLY** because you chose to buy the TBC Deluxe Edition?<br /><br />
This Addon sure will teach these kids how to behave.

## How to install
1. Click the "Code" button & select "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the folder to your `Interface/AddOns` folder
3. Rename the extracted folder to `BuggAddon`

BuggAddon should now be visible in your in-game AddOn list. You can view this by "Esc" -> "AddOns".
## Add your own emotes
You can edit or add your own emotes that will be triggered whenever some n00b `/spit` on you.
* Open `buggaddon.lua` with any text editor (eg. Notepad)
* Add your prefered comeback to the list of strings

```
Strings containing the word "name" will be replaced with the player's name who `/spit` on you
```

#### Examples
buggaddon.lua | In-game emote
--------------|--------------
"balls so hard." | "Buggorm balls so hard."
"LOLOLOLOLs at name." | "Buggorm LOLOLOLOLs at Vale."
"is sorry to hear about name's genital warts." | "Buggorm is sorry to hear about Vale's genital warts."
